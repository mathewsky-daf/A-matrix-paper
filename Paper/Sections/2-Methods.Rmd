While early studies of inheritance in octoploid strawberry found meiotic behavior to be a mix between disomic and polysomic [e.g. @LerceteauKohler2003], more recent studies have found that inheritance is disomic [@RousseauGueutin2008; @Tennessen2014; @Sargent2016; @Hardigan2020] and that analyses employing diploid Mendelian genetics are appropriate [@Pincot2021]. Therefore, we used the option ploidy = 2 when constructing the A matrix in AGHmatrix. 

*If we do explore an octoploid A matrix and find that it is a better fit than diploid, then we should explore different levels of double reduction (the probability that two sister chromatids pass into the same gamete), as per @Amadeu2016.*

Recent studies have found that a small amount of genetic variance could be attributed to dominance [@Feldmann2024; @Sleper2025]. Thus, we also constructed a dominance relationship matrix in AGHmatrix using the option dominance = TRUE.

## Construction of A-matrices
Despite strawberry being octoploid, we used the option ploidy = 2 when constructing the A matrix in AGHmatrix due to its diploid-behaving manner. 

*If we do explore an octoploid A matrix and find that it is a better fit than diploid, then we should explore different levels of double reduction (the probability that two sister chromatids pass into the same gamete), as per @Amadeu2016.*

Recent studies have found that a small amount of genetic variance could be attributed to dominance [@Feldmann2024; @Sleper2025]. Thus, we also constructed a dominance relationship matrix in AGHmatrix using the option dominance = TRUE.

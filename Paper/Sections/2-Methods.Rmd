<!-- Methods -->

While early studies of inheritance in octoploid strawberry found meiotic behavior to be a mix between disomic and polysomic [e.g. @LerceteauKohler2003], more recent studies have found that inheritance is disomic [@RousseauGueutin2008; @Tennessen2014; @Sargent2016; @Hardigan2020]. Therefore, we used the option ploidy = 2 when constructing the A matrix in AGHmatrix.

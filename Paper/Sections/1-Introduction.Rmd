Various papers analysing strawbery data have included relationship matrices constructed of somewhat arbitrary pedigree generation depths, ranging from four to 20 [@Whitaker2012; @Kennedy2014; @Osorio2014; @Paynter2014].

Repeated measures or longitudinal analysis of yield data does not appear to be standard practice in strawberry, with research groups instead summing individual harvests to obtain a total season yield (e.g. @Cockerton2021; @Gezan2017; @Fan2024; @Osorio2021). Similarly for fruit weight, a common method is to divide total (marketable) yield by the total number of (marketable) fruit across a season (e.g. @Sleper2025; @Osorio2021; @Whitaker2012), or average across all harvests to obtain a mean weight (e.g. @Prohaska2024). 

Repeated measures analyses have been used in other horticultural crops to model traits measured temporally, for example in macadamia [@Hardner2023], sweet cherry [@Piaskowski2018] and.... *Ky to insert her favourite examples (though perhaps we need to reword "horticultural")*. 

Yield and fruit weight are two of the most important traits in driving profitability in strawberry [@Herrington2012]. Increases in yield lead to an increase in gross margin [@Herrington2012]. In the subtropical region, increased early season (in April and May) production is a current aim of the ASBP due to the high market punnet prices compared to the rest of the season [@Herrington2012]. Large fruit sizes lead to substantial increases in gross margin, as the time to pick and pack a fruit does not change with size, but larger fruit will result in more punnets and thus be more profitable for growers compared to fewer punnets of small fruit [@Herrington2012]. Fruit weight tends to decrease as temperatures increase [@Menzel2021], and so average fruit weight in August in the subtropical region and in December to February in the temperate region are particularly important factors in ASBP selection decisions. It is for these reasons that the ASBP evaluates total season yield and average fruit weight as well as for individual weeks and months.

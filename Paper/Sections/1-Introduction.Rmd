The Australian Strawberry Breeding Program (ASBP) is the nation’s sole strawberry breeding initiative and is lead by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. The program's objective is to develop public varieties that offer high profitability for producers paired with reduced costs of cultivation and satisfy consumer demands to drive repeat purchases, for Australia's three strawberry growing climatic regions: subtropical, temperate and Mediterranean. In the 2023/24 period, ASBP varieties accounted for about 90% of the total commercial subtropical strawberry plant sales across Australia, and 51% at the national level [@HortInn2024]. Australia's strawberry sector was valued at the farm gate at approximately $507.5 million, producing around 80,741 tonnes of strawberries in the same timeframe [@HortInn2024].

Cultivated strawberry (*Fragaria* x *ananassa* Duchesne ex Rozier; `2n = 8X = 56`) is an open-pollinated, highly heterozygous allo-octoploid, derived through hybridisation between *Fragaria virginiana* and *F. chiloensis* [@Edger2019; @Darrow1966]. While early studies of inheritance in octoploid strawberry found meiotic behavior to be a mix between disomic and polysomic [e.g. @LerceteauKohler2003], more recent studies have found that inheritance is disomic [@RousseauGueutin2008; @Tennessen2014; @Sargent2016; @Hardigan2020] and that analyses employing diploid Mendelian genetics are appropriate [@Pincot2021].

Yield and fruit weight are two of the most important traits in driving profitability in strawberry [@Herrington2012]. Increases in yield lead to an increase in gross margin [@Herrington2012]. In the subtropical region, increased early season (in April and May) production is a current aim of the ASBP due to the high market punnet prices compared to the rest of the season [@Herrington2012]. Large fruit sizes lead to substantial increases in gross margin, as the time to pick and pack a fruit does not change with size, but larger fruit will result in more punnets and thus be more profitable for growers compared to fewer punnets of small fruit [@Herrington2012]. Fruit weight tends to decrease as temperatures increase [@Menzel2021], and so average fruit weight in August in the subtropical region and in December to February in the temperate region are particularly important factors in ASBP selection decisions. It is for these reasons that the ASBP evaluates total season yield and average fruit weight as well as for individual weeks and months.

The ASBP uses pedigree information in the routine analysis of all traits to estimate breeding values for parental selection. The total genetic effects for each genotype, the so-called “clonal values”, are also estimated from these models. The analyses are performed in the linear mixed model framework and follow @Oakey2006 and @Oakey2007 which uses the numerator relationship matrix generated from pedigree information. 

*Theory? More levels of pedigree will lead to more accurate estimates and larger additive genetic variance? see @Yang2016.*

There are a number of studies that have investigated the effect of various pedigree depths in breeding programs. @Atkin2009 investigated six different levels of sugar cane pedigree as well as varying numbers of years of trial data to determine the minimum levels of both to accurate estimate breeding values. Their evaluation methods included a comparison of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) between models, additive genetic and additive-by-environment variance estimates, and correlations between breeding values of the full dataset and subsets. Their results found that a minimum pedigree depth of three generations and five years of trial data were required for their crop and dataset. In their simulation study of pig populations, @Yang2016 compared estimates of genetic parameters and reliability of estimated breeding values (EBVs) for 1-24 generations included in their pedigree and with different numbers of sires and dams. In their simulations, three to five generations of phenotypic records plus one to three generations of ancestors produced EBVs as accurate as the full dataset. In their development of the AGHmatrix R package, @Amadeu2016 also investigated pedigree depths of 5, 10, 20, and 30 years in blueberry. They found that shallow pedigrees underestimated actual kinship coefficients between individuals as well as incorrect determination of double reduction levels, a phenomenon that affects polyploidy organisms such as the autotetraploid blueberry, and thus estimation of genetic parameters [@Amadeu2016].

Various papers analysing strawbery data have included relationship matrices constructed of somewhat arbitrary pedigree generation depths, ranging from four to 20 [@Whitaker2012; @Kennedy2014; @Osorio2014; @Paynter2014]. Currently, the breeding program uses a standard pedigree depth of 10 generations *out of a total of X generations*. It is of interest to determine what an optimal pedigree depth could be and the effect of changing pedigree depth on the genetic variance estimates, the breeding and clonal value estimates and the prediction accuracies these estimates.

The ASBP have implemented the contemporary group technology described in @Smith2021 to determine that for the subtropical program 5 years was sufficient, and for the temperate program 4 years (unpublished).

Repeated measures or longitudinal analysis of yield data does not appear to be standard practice in strawberry, with research groups instead summing individual harvests to obtain a total season yield (e.g. @Cockerton2021; @Gezan2017; @Fan2024; @Osorio2021). Similarly for fruit weight, a common method is to divide total (marketable) yield by the total number of (marketable) fruit across a season (e.g. @Sleper2025; @Osorio2021; @Whitaker2012), or average across all harvests to obtain a mean weight (e.g. @Prohaska2024). Repeated measures analyses have been used in other horticultural crops to model traits measured temporally, for example in macadamia [@Hardner2023], sweet cherry [@Piaskowski2018] and.... *Ky to insert her favourite examples (though perhaps we need to reword "horticultural")*. 

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of depth of pedigree used to calculate the numerator relationship matrix on the additive and non-additive genetic effects, the breeding and clonal value estimates and their respective accuracies. Yield and fruit weight will be used in the study as example traits. A secondary purpose of this study is to investigate whether a repeated measures analysis is more appropriate in strawberries than analysing each harvest week individually and then summing or averaging data to obtain season values.
